Open Life Science (OLS) is supported through a mix of philantropic support, personal donations, grant funding, and partnerships with institutions.

# Funding

In the table below, we list our funding from philantropies, grants, and institutional patrnerships.

Personal donations come from mentors, experts and other contributors of OLS who chose to donate the honoraria for their work to our general funds, as well as fundraising campaigns, e.g. during cohort graduations.

| Funder | Amount | Duration  | Date of Award | Purpose | Supporting documentation |
|--------|--------|-----------|---------------|---------|--------------------------|
{%- for f in site.data.funding %}
| [{{ organizations[f.funder].name }}]({{ organizations[f.funder].site }}) | {{ f.amount }} {{ f.currency }} | {{ f.duration }} | {{ f.date_award }} | {{ f.purpose }} | |
{%- endfor %}

{%- if f.doc -%}[{{ f.doc.title }}]({{ f.doc.url }}){%- endif -%}
